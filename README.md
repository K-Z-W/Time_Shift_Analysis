# REST - *Time Shift Analysis*
Hi, thank you for your interest in my work!  
This is a *__matlab__* toolbox for time shift analysis of *__fMRI__* data.    
The preprocessing part of this toolbox is based on [RESTplus](http://restfmri.net/forum/RESTplusV1.2) and [SPM12](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).    
The detailed description of time shift analysis was showed in the following reference.
